Both players have to choose a 'n' digit number and then make guesses to find out the opponent's number. Once a guess is made, the other player's answer has to be:  'n' good or 'n' more or less or nothing.

'n' good: means that a certain number is placed in the correct position

'n' more or less: means that certain number appears in the guess but is not in the correct position.
